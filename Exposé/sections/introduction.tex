As a student in the field of Wirtschaftsinformatik (Business Informatics) and a member of HISolution's cloud formations team, 
I have witnessed firsthand the growing significance of cloud computing in modern business operations. 
The increasing adoption of cloud services has led to the emergence of multi-cloud solutions, 
where organizations leverage services from various cloud providers to meet diverse requirements. 
This exposé aims to draw from my academic background 
and professional experience to explore the impact of different integration levels (virtualization levels) of services offered by cloud providers 
on the management effort and associated costs within multi-cloud environments.
