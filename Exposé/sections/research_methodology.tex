In the context of multi-cloud, when it is required to manage services and resources 
across multiple cloud providers, the focus on managemnet effort and cost implications should 
align with the unique challenges and opportunities presented by a multi-cloud environment. 
Key points in focus are:

\subsection{Measurement of Management Effort}

\paragraph{Orchestration and Automation}
Multi-cloud environments often involve coordinating activities across different cloud providers, 
and automation can streamline complex workflows \cite{rajAutomatedMulticloudOperations2018}.\\
The metric Time to provision/de-provision of resources is useful to
measure how quickly resources can be deployed or 
removed across different cloud providers, 
reflecting the efficiency of orchestration and automation processes.

% Measuring cost implications and management in different integration levels in a single cloud compared to a multi-cloud environment involves some key distinctions. 
% Here's a comparison of the common and academic approaches to measure these aspects in both scenarios:

% \subsubsection{Management Effort}

% \paragraph{Single Cloud}
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Common: In a single cloud, common operational metrics, such as time to provision, incident response time, and scaling efficiency, 
%     are used to measure management effort. Tools and services provided by the cloud provider may simplify management.
%     \item Academic: Academic research in a single cloud context may involve studying management complexity models, 
%     conducting surveys or case studies on management practices, and developing metrics for assessing the cognitive load of administrators.
% \end{itemize}

% \paragraph{Multi-Cloud}
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Common: Measuring management effort in a multi-cloud environment can be more challenging due to the diversity of cloud providers and services used. 
%     Organizations need to consider factors like resource orchestration, security, and data governance across multiple clouds.
%     \item Academic: In multi-cloud scenarios, academic research may focus on understanding the complexities of cross-cloud management, 
%     developing models for measuring management overhead in a multi-cloud environment, and evaluating best practices for achieving efficient management.
% \end{itemize}

% \subsubsection{Cost Implications}

% \paragraph{Single Cloud}

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Common: In a single cloud environment, common cost metrics such as Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), monthly billing analysis, 
%     and cost per resource unit are applied to assess the cost implications. Cost allocation is often simpler as resources are centralized.
%     \item Academic: Academic research in a single cloud environment may involve developing cost models specific to that cloud provider,
%     conducting TCO analyses for different services, and studying cost optimization techniques tailored to the provider's ecosystem.

% \end{itemize}
% \paragraph{Multi-Cloud}
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Common: Measuring cost implications in a multi-cloud setup involves aggregating costs from different providers, 
%     understanding billing intricacies of each cloud, and monitoring resource usage across multiple environments. 
%     Cost allocation and chargeback can be more complex.
%     \item Academic: In a multi-cloud setting, academic research may focus on developing cost models that consider multi-cloud scenarios, 
%     assessing the financial impact of data transfer costs between clouds, and optimizing resource placement across providers.
% \end{itemize}



% In summary, the key difference between measuring cost implications and management in single cloud and multi-cloud environments is the added complexity 
% and diversity introduced by the use of multiple cloud providers in the latter case. 
% Both common operational metrics and academic research approaches can provide valuable insights in both scenarios, 
% but multi-cloud settings require additional considerations and methodologies to account for the unique challenges and opportunities presented by multiple cloud providers.
