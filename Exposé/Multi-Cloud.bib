  abstract = {Amazon Web Services unveiled their "Lambda" platform in late 2014. Since then, each of the major cloud computing infrastructure providers has released services supporting a similar style of deployment and operation, where rather than deploying and running monolithic services, or dedicated virtual machines, users are able to deploy individual functions, and pay only for the time that their code is actually executing. These technologies are gathered together under the marketing term "serverless" and the providers suggest that they have the potential to significantly change how client/server applications are designed, developed and operated. This paper presents two case industrial studies of early adopters, showing how migrating an application to the Lambda deployment architecture reduced hosting costs - by between 66\% and 95\% - and discusses how further adoption of this trend might influence common software architecture design practices.},

These services are offered at different prices using various pricing schemes and techniques. End users will favor the service provider offering the best QoS with the lowest price. Therefore, applying a fair pricing model will attract more customers and achieve higher revenues for service providers. This work focuses on comparing many employed and proposed pricing models techniques and highlights the pros and cons of each. The comparison is based on many aspects such as fairness, pricing approach, and utilization period. Such an approach provides a solid ground for designing better models in the future. We have found that most approaches are theoretical and not implemented in the real market, although their simulation results are very promising. Moreover, most of these approaches are biased toward the service provider.},

However, it is more flexible than traditional ITO because no service volumes and no long contract periods need to be fixed. Companies that employ cloud computing may use several cloud service suppliers at the same time. Similarly, many companies that employ traditional ITO have contracts with several vendors. If the rendered services need to be coordinated, additional efforts are needed to manage this multi-sourcing environment. We find that the coordination arrangements known in multi-sourcing also occur in multi-cloud computing, but that significant differences exist in the actual coordination implementation. Based on the technology applied in cloud computing, new software has been developed to automate the integration tasks. In addition, many new players who offer coordination of multiple clouds as a service have entered the market.},

  abstract = {Information Technology (IT) data services provided by cloud providers (CPs) face significant challenges in maintaining services and their continuity during a disaster. The primary concern for data recovery (DR) in the cloud is finding ways to ensure that the process of data backup and recovery is effective in providing high data availability, flexibility, and reliability at a reasonable cost. Numerous data backup solutions have been designed for a single-cloud architecture; however, making a single copy of data may not be sufficient because damage to data may cause irrecoverable loss during a disaster. Other solutions have involved multiple replications on more than one remote cloud provider (Multi-Cloud). Most suggested solutions have proposed obtaining a high level of reliability by producing at least three replicas of the data and either storing all replicas at a single location or distributing them over numerous remote locations. The drawbacks to this approach are high costs, large storage space consumption and (especially in the case of data-intensive cloud-based applications) increased network traffic. In this paper, we discuss the issues raised by DR for both Single-Cloud and Multi-Cloud environments. We also examine previous studies concerning cloud-based DR to highlight issues that researchers of cloud-based DR have considered to be most important.},

  abstract = {The use of cloud computing has increased rapidly in many organizations. Cloud computing provides many benefits in terms of low cost and accessibility of data. Ensuring the security of cloud computing is a major factor in the cloud computing environment, as users often store sensitive information with cloud storage providers but these providers may be untrusted. Dealing with "single cloud" providers is predicted to become less popular with customers due to risks of service availability failure and the possibility of malicious insiders in the single cloud. A movement towards "multi-clouds", or in other words, "interclouds" or "cloud-of-clouds" has emerged recently. This paper surveys recent research related to single and multi-cloud security and addresses possible solutions. It is found that the research into the use of multi-cloud providers to maintain security has received less attention from the research community than has the use of single clouds. This work aims to promote the use of multi-clouds due to its ability to reduce security risks that affect the cloud computing user.},

In this context, the possibility to store a huge amount of data and files on remote third-party Cloud storage providers is becoming an even more concrete practice. Unfortunately, there is not any guarantee regarding data availability and reliability of such providers. In such a context, if the Cloud wants to use the storage as a service of another Cloud, it has only to trust it. A possible solution consists of using a Multi-Cloud Storage (MCS) system. However, how organizations should compose their own MCS system on geo-distribution basis is not trivial at all. In this paper, we specifically discuss how to optimize the overall system in terms of data storage and retrieval by testing and validating a MCS system composed of three major Cloud Storage providers; Dropbox, Google Drive and Copy. Experiments have proved that the choice of the Cloud storage providers where to store files depends on the data transfer performance according to the file chunk size. In addition, we demonstrated that not always the provider that offers the best performance in upload also offers the best performance in download.},

  abstract = {Cloud users can acquire resources in the form of virtual machines (VMs) instances for computing. These instances can be on-demand, reserved and spot instances. Spot-priced virtual machines are offered at the reduced cost compared to on-demand and reserved but are unreliable to use as their availability depends on user's bid. To use spot instances (preemptible VMs), users have to bid for resources and trade-off between monetary cost and reliability as reliability increases with the increase in cost of execution. The cost of execution can be reduced significantly with the use of preemptible VM instances. These instances are only available until users bid higher in comparison with spot price that is fixed by the cloud providers. Hence, it becomes a critical challenge to minimize the associated cost and increases the reliability for a given deadline. In this article, an algorithm has been designed for predicting the spot price to facilitate the users in bidding. Further, a checkpointing algorithm has been proposed for saving the task's progress at optimal time intervals by the use of the proposed spot price prediction algorithm. The proposed algorithms in the article emphasize the use of preprocessed data for prediction of prices in short intervals. The prediction algorithm is based on machine learning techniques. It predicts the price and provides a comprehensive comparison for prediction of the prices for long term (12 h) as well as short term (10 min). For predicting the long-term and short-term prices, different machine learning techniques have been used on the basis of least error in prediction. The best suitable machine learning algorithm with least error is selected for prediction as well as checkpointing. Using these algorithms, one can improve reliability and reduce cost of computing on preemptible VM instances significantly.

  abstract = {Cloud computing is gaining popularity among small and medium-sized enterprises. The cost of cloud resources plays a significant role for these companies and this is why cloud resource optimization has become a very important issue. Numerous methods have been proposed to optimize cloud computing resources according to actual demand and to reduce the cost of cloud services. Such approaches mostly focus on a single factor (i.e., compute power) optimization, but this can yield unsatisfactory results in real-world cloud workloads which are multi-factor, dynamic and irregular. This article presents a novel approach which uses anomaly detection, machine learning and particle swarm optimization to achieve a cost-optimal cloud resource configuration. It is a complete solution which works in a closed loop without the need for external supervision or initialization, builds knowledge about the usage patterns of the system being optimized and filters out anomalous situations on the fly. Our solution can adapt to changes in both system load and the cloud provider's pricing plan. It was tested in Microsoft's cloud environment Azure using data collected from a real-life system. Experiments demonstrate that over a period of 10 months, a cost reduction of 85 percent was achieved.},

In terms of cloud services, it is achieved by providing and developing services that are platform-dependent with proprietary technologies, interfaces or formats. This can be a huge barrier to adopt cloud services because customers are tied to specific vendors which prevent portability through proprietary or a limited set of interfaces. As consequence, customers are hindered to alternate venders easily without substantial migration costs. A multi-cloud strategy is one possible way to avoid vendor lock-ins. The scope of the is paper is to design and implement a solution-stack to provide web services which operate independent from proprietary cloud service provider technologies. We provide a solution stack prototype which will support key functionalities such as portability, interoperability and platform-independency by implementing modern technologies and standards.},

  abstract = {Cloud providers sell their idle capacity on markets through an auction-like mechanism to increase their return on investment. The instances sold in this way are called spot instances. In spite that spot instances are usually 90\% cheaper than on-demand instances, they can be terminated by provider when their bidding prices are lower than market prices. Thus, they are largely used to provision fault-tolerant applications only. In this paper, we explore how to utilize spot instances to provision web applications, which are usually considered as availability-critical. The idea is to take advantage of differences in price among various types of spot instances to reach both high availability and significant cost saving. We first propose a fault-tolerant model for web applications provisioned by spot instances. Based on that, we devise novel cost-efficient auto-scaling polices that comply with the defined fault-tolerant semantics for hourly billed cloud markets. We implemented the proposed model and policies both on a simulation testbed for repeatable validation and Amazon EC2. The experiments on the simulation testbed and EC2 show that the proposed approach can greatly reduce resource cost and still achieve satisfactory Quality of Service (QoS) in terms of response time and availability.},

The attractiveness of cloud for HPC is the capability to run large applications on powerful, scalable hardware without needing to actually own or maintain this hardware. In this paper, we conduct a detailed comparison of HPC applications running on three cloud providers, Amazon EC2, Microsoft Azure and Rackspace. We analyze three important characteristics of HPC, deployment facilities, performance and cost efficiency and compare them to a cluster of machines. For the experiments, we used the well-known NAS parallel benchmarks as an example of general scientific HPC applications to examine the computational and communication performance. Our results show that HPC applications can run efficiently on the cloud. However, care must be taken when choosing the provider, as the differences between them are large. The best cloud provider depends on the type and behavior of the application, as well as the intended usage scenario. Furthermore, our results show that HPC in the cloud can have a higher performance and cost efficiency than a traditional cluster, up to 27\% and 41\%, respectively.},

Service unavailability does not affect just user experience but is also translated into direct costs for cloud providers and companies. Part of this costs is due to SLA breaches, once interruption time greater than those signed in the contract generate financial penalties. Thus, cloud providers have tried to identify failure points and estimate the availability of their services. This paper proposes models to assess the availability of services running in a cloud data center infrastructure. The models follow the TIA-942 standard. We propose Tier I and IV models using the Reliability Block Diagram (RBD) to allow modeling of different types of applications, and Stochastic Petri Net (SPN) to represent the failure behavior of information technology (IT) components in a data center. We perform stationary analysis to measure the service availability, and sensitivity analysis to understand which metrics have major impacts on data center availability.},

At the same time, we are observing a fragmentation of the market in terms of pricing schemes, virtual machine offers and value-add features. In the early phase of cloud adoption, the price model was dominated by fixed prices. However, cloud market trend shows that dynamic pricing schemes utilization is being increased. In this plan, prices change according to demand in each cloud provider. In general, it is difficult for users to search cloud prices and decide where to put their resources. In this paper, we propose a scheduling model for optimizing virtual cluster placements across available cloud offers. This scheduler uses some variables such as average prices or cloud prices trends for suggesting an optimal deployment. Also, this scheduler is part of a cloud broker which automates actions and makes them transparent for users. The performance of our model is evaluated in a real-world cloud environment and the results show that user's investment decreases when part of the virtual infrastructure is dynamically distributed among clouds instead of maintaining it in a fixed one.},

Findings \textendash{} It was found that decision processes in cloud computing are conducted ad hoc and lack systematic methods. The presented method raises the awareness of indirect and hidden costs in cloud computing. Research limitations/implications \textendash{} Some restrictive assumptions were made. For instance, cost types that focus on an existing internal IT infrastructure were hidden. Future research can combine risk and security aspects by means of a TCO approach. Additionally, benefits management in cloud computing is another new research field that can, for instance, be explored by means of cost-benefit analyses. Practical implications \textendash{} The analysis of relevant cost types and factors of cloud computing services is an important pillar of decision making in cloud computing. The software tool allows for an easy application of the TCO model with reasonable effort. Originality/value \textendash{} The paper provides an evaluated mathematical model for the calculation of the TCO of cloud computing services. With this tool, decision makers are able to decide whether outsourcing into the cloud is monetarily attractive; to be more specific, whether the costs associated with cloud computing services are lower than with a pre-existing infrastructure.},

For these web service providers, the cost of cloud computing usage becomes a big part of their IT department cost. Facing the diverse pricing models including on-demand, reserved, and spot instance, it is difficult for web service providers to optimize their cost. This paper introduces a new cloud brokerage service to help web service providers to minimize their cloud computing cost for deadline-constrained batch jobs, which have been a significant workload in web services. Our cloud brokerage service associates each batch job with deadline, and always tries to use cheaper reserved instances for computation to maintain a minimum cost. We achieve this with the following two steps: (1) given a set of jobs' specifications, determine the scheduling of jobs, (2) given the scheduling and pricing options, find an optimal instance renting strategy. We prove that both problems in two steps are computation intractable, and propose approximation algorithms for them. Trace-based evaluation shows that our cloud brokerage service can reduce up to 57\% of the cloud computing cost.},
