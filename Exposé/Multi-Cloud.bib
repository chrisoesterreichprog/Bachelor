  abstract = {The use of cloud computing has increased rapidly in many organizations. Cloud computing provides many benefits in terms of low cost and accessibility of data. Ensuring the security of cloud computing is a major factor in the cloud computing environment, as users often store sensitive information with cloud storage providers but these providers may be untrusted. Dealing with "single cloud" providers is predicted to become less popular with customers due to risks of service availability failure and the possibility of malicious insiders in the single cloud. A movement towards "multi-clouds", or in other words, "interclouds" or "cloud-of-clouds" has emerged recently. This paper surveys recent research related to single and multi-cloud security and addresses possible solutions. It is found that the research into the use of multi-cloud providers to maintain security has received less attention from the research community than has the use of single clouds. This work aims to promote the use of multi-clouds due to its ability to reduce security risks that affect the cloud computing user.},

Cloud computing is based on several other computing research areas such as HPC, virtualization, utility computing and grid computing. In order to make clear the essential of cloud computing, we propose the characteristics of this area which make cloud computing being cloud computing and distinguish it from other research areas. The cloud computing has its own conceptional, technical, economic and user experience characteristics. The service oriented, loose coupling, strong fault tolerant, business model and ease use are main characteristics of cloud computing. Clear insights into cloud computing will help the development and adoption of this evolving technology both for academe and industry.},

First, the basics of cloud computing concepts are discussed. Next we outline some challenges facing cloud computing, and discuss how multi-cloud systems including multi-clouds, hybrid clouds, federated clouds, and cross-clouds may be used to deal with some of these issues. Finally, multi-cloud systems may also be used in conjunction with new developing technologies such as Big Data and Machine Learning, leading to exciting innovations. These are reviewed in brief. Our goal is to provide a modern look at the state of the art in multi-cloud computing and review open issues in the field. The goal is that this paper will help the reader to understand challenges facing cloud computing, how multi-cloud computing addresses some of these issues, and inspire community excitement at the future integration of multi-cloud platforms with other novel technologies.},

Deployment in the cloud provides organizations with flexible and scalable virtual computing resources. A cloud deployment model is the type of architecture in which a cloud system is deployed. These models differ in terms of administration, ownership, access control, and security protocols. This paper describes the different types of cloud computing service models and deployment models; it also gives us a comparative study of various clouds using many factors. The comparison is simply based on various factors such as reliability, cost, data control, workload, performance, and many other cloud parameters.},

  abstract = {A vendor lock-in makes customers dependent of a propriety product, service or technology provided by a vendor. In terms of cloud services, it is achieved by providing and developing services that are platform-dependent with proprietary technologies, interfaces or formats. This can be a huge barrier to adopt cloud services because customers are tied to specific vendors which prevent portability through proprietary or a limited set of interfaces. As consequence, customers are hindered to alternate venders easily without substantial migration costs. A multi-cloud strategy is one possible way to avoid vendor lock-ins. The scope of the is paper is to design and implement a solution-stack to provide web services which operate independent from proprietary cloud service provider technologies. We provide a solution stack prototype which will support key functionalities such as portability, interoperability and platform-independency by implementing modern technologies and standards.},
